 * @class MSEdgeControl
 * @brief Stores edges and lanes, performs moving of vehicle
 *
 * In order to avoid touching all lanes, even the empty ones, this class stores
 *  and updates the information about "active" lanes, those that have at least
 *  one vehicle on them. During longitudinal movement, this can be simply
 *  achieved through return values of the MSLane-methods, signalling either
 *  that the lane got active or inactive. This is but not possible when
 *  changing lanes, we have to go through the lanes, here. Also, we have to
 *  add lanes on which a vehicle was inserted, separately, doing this into
 *  ("myChangedStateLanes") which entries are integrated at the begin of is step
 *  in "patchActiveLanes".
